pseudo code for skeleton hunt

goal of the game is to complete the skeleton
players will take turns
one round each
set on a timer

10 hands(shots or chances)
6 body parts
40 seconds(this will vary...parameters set off the top of my head)

OPENING PAGE
players on screen...modal for rules and instructions on top left corner (modal...open and close..text inside)

make a background 





tow big images of characters and then you enter your names
...image divs....nothing to them. just photos of two cartoons
name....an input box with submit on it. not a form so that it wont disappear ...just an input box that overtakes character..so you hit submit and then a function runs to make that disappear and just leave the actual text

click start button(this will make everything clear  and open the next window)
images will fade out. gameplay screen will fade in

box on bottom for player name

box on bottom for timer

container on top left that has images running.
